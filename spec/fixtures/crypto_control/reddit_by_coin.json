  "description": "So, I received Litecoin today via a paper wallet. I'm not sure of the amount, and am trying to find out and deposit it into a wallet. I downloaded Litecoin Core for my desktop, but don't see a way to \"deposit\" my Litecoin. I'm sure it's probably obvious, but I'm missing it, and any help would be appreciated.",
